To run this drop wizard application you need to create a new 'Application' run from the Edit configurations tab.

    For Main class = choose the Rest Service Resource
    For server arguments = server config.yml
    Tick Single instance
   
Ps this micro service can only work if the dependant microservices have already started prior to itself
